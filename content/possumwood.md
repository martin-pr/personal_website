# Possumwood

Possumwood (named after [Sandbox Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hura_crepitans)) is a **graph-based procedural sandbox**, implementing concepts of graph-based [visual programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language) in a simple interface. It is intended to provide a user-friendly and accessible UI for experimenting with common computer graphics algorithms and libraries (e.g., [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/), [CGAL](http://www.cgal.org/), [WildMagic](https://www.geometrictools.com/), [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)).

Possumwood is built on top of a simple graph-evaluation engine and a Qt-based node graph editor, with an OpenGL viewport. Its main strength is its extensibility - it is trivial to implement new plugins supporting new libraries and data types, which allows free and user-friendly experimentation with parameters of each algorithm.

**Possumwood is a sandbox, not a production tool.** As a sandbox, it is quite open to radical changes and redesign, and for the time being it does not guarantee any form of backwards compatibility.
